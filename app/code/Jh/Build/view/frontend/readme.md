## M2 post-build performance improvements

### Why

Magento 2 uses RequireJS in 'development' mode. This means all files are loaded
individually over the network, resulting in hundreds of requests.

Whilst not the optimal solution, a huge step forward in terms of 'time to meaningful interaction'
would be to combine many files into 1 or 2 bundles. This would incur a slightly higher 'first download' cost,
but the time the user has to wait to interact with the dynamic parts of the site can halved, or better.

### How

The Magento 2 build system (for deployments) runs completely in PHP - which means they cannot
run the RequireJS Optimizer tool. So our work to solve this involves 3 important steps.

    - 1: Each project will have a Build module that contains some base configuration for the bundles
    - 2: Following a `static-content:deploy`, read/parse the `requirejs-config.js` file that is
    generated by Magento and combine it with the project-specfic config file. This will determine which modules
    will go into each bundle.
    - 3: Use that configuration to run the RequireJS Optimizer (acting on the `/pub` directory)


### Per-Project Implementation

#### Package requirements

    - NodeJS (version 8, LTS)
    - `m2-builder` package

#### Code Requirements

    - A base 'module' will be provided that contains no site-specific items. This can then be added too.

#### Adding modules to a bundle
